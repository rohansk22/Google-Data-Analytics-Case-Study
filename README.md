As part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I took up Case Study 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

In this case study, I was a marketing analyst for Cyclistic - a bike-share company in Chicago. In order to maximizing the number of annual memberships, the
team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will
design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

I followed theses steps in my Analysis: 
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act

Tools used: 
Microsoft Excel,
R - to clean and process data,
Tableau - to visualize the data 

All finding of the case study are included in the report: Case_study_report.
